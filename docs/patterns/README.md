## What are Patterns?

Patterns are reusable solutions to common problems. Each pattern in this directory provides:
- **Step-by-step instructions**
- **Code examples**
- **Common pitfalls to avoid**
- **Best practices**

## When to Use Patterns

Use these patterns when:
- Building a new feature
- Extending existing functionality
- Learning how the stack works
- Ensuring consistency across the codebase

## Pattern Categories

### Database Patterns
- Adding tables
- Defining relationships
- Writing queries
- Handling migrations

### API Patterns
- CRUD operations
- Authentication
- Input validation
- Error handling

### UI Patterns
- Forms with validation
- Protected pages
- Client components
- Server components

### AI Patterns
- Chat interfaces
- Streaming responses
- Structured output
- Tool calling

## Contributing Patterns

When you solve a problem, consider documenting it as a pattern:
1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory
2. Follow the existing pattern structure
3. Include code examples
4. Update this README

These patterns are designed to help both **human developers** and **AI coding assistants** build features quickly and correctly.

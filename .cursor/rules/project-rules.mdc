# Project Rules

**For comprehensive architecture and patterns, see AGENTS.md in the project root.**

**Additional scoped rules are available in:**
- `core.mdc` - Core principles and tech stack
- `database.mdc` - Database patterns and security
- `ai.mdc` - AI integration patterns
- `security.mdc` - Authentication and security

## Workflow Rules

- Always run the LINT and TYPECHECK scripts after completing your changes. This is to check for any issues.
- NEVER start the dev server yourself. If you need something from the terminal, ask the user to provide it to you.
